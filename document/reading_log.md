* IHS introduced with discussion of least squares problems with convex constraints.
* Original motivation is to address sub-optimality (w.r.t. solution approximation) of classical least squares sketching.
* Sketch dimension per iteration only needs to be proportional to dimension of optimal solution.
* log(1/epsilon) iterations for epsilon-accurate solution.
* Ideas: regularized regression, convex Lp-norm regression problems.

* The convergence rate results are derived based on the limiting spectral distributions, which are obtained by applying results from random matrix theory/free probability.

### Xia, 2019

* Light introduction and decent starting point to random matrix theory.
