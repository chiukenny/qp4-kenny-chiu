\section{Comment}

I would like to briefly comment on the iterative Hessian sketch/Newton sketch literature. While the body of works that focus on these algorithms is fairly substantial with many new developments in recent years, there appears to be only one or two research groups driving this portion of the literature and reinforcing their position with many self-citations. Many of these citations are to unpublished papers or concurrent papers. To make matters more confusing, there are instances of cyclical citations where one paper references an old version of another paper, and the new version of the other paper references the paper that references its old version (e.g., \citep{Lacotte:2020} and \citep{Lacotte:2020b}). This made tracking the lineage of the developments in this literature a bit of a nightmare.
