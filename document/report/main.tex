\section{Comment}

I would like to briefly comment on the iterative Hessian sketch/Newton sketch literature. While the body of works that focus on these algorithms is fairly substantial with many new developments in recent years, there appears to be only one or two research groups driving this portion of the literature and reinforcing their position with many self-citations. Many of these citations reference concurrent papers or unpublished papers with multiple versions. To make matters more confusing, there are instances of cyclical citations where one paper references another paper that referenced an old version of the first paper (e.g., \citep{Lacotte:2020} and \citep{Lacotte:2020b}). This made tracking the lineage of the developments in this literature a bit of a nightmare.
