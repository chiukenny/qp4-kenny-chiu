## Feb. 15

* Start organization of project report.

## Feb. 13

* Likely unable to make further progress on ridge regression theory. The full Newton sketch idea would not be helpful as the main problem of not being able to simplify expressions into orthogonal/Haar matrices remains.
* Considered weighted least squares as another method to analyze, but the theory for ordinary least squares should apply to IWS rewritten as a regular LS problem.
* Updated quantile regression proposal with more context.

## Feb. 12

* Attempted to follow Theorem 4.1 for ridge regression. An analogous result may be possible, but there are challenges such as not being able to give closed form expressions for the inverse moments.
* Could an approach based on a full Newton sketch of the Hessian work?

## Feb. 11

* Continued with ridge regression theory. One obstacle in proof of Theorem 3.1 seems to be the use of rotational invariance of matrix. Corresponding matrix in ridge regression does not seem to have this property. Approach for Theorem 4.1 likely may work under additional initialization assumptions.

## Feb. 9

* Started looking into ridge regression for project.

## Feb. 6

* Finished draft of proposal 1.

## Feb. 5

* Started proposal 1 (sketched interior point algorithm for quantile regression).

## Feb. 2-4

* Started thinking about possible project proposals and reviewing the underdetermined least squares, quantile regression and related literatures for ideas.

## Jan. 28

* Finished first draft of summary.

## Jan. 27
