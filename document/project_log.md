## Feb. 11

* Continued with ridge regression theory. One obstacle in proof of Theorem 3.1 seems to be the use of rotational invariance of matrix. Corresponding matrix in ridge regression does not seem to have this property. Approach for Theorem 4.1 likely may work under additional initialization assumptions.

## Feb. 9

* Started looking into ridge regression for project.

## Feb. 6

* Finished draft of proposal 1.

## Feb. 5

* Started proposal 1 (sketched interior point algorithm for quantile regression).

## Feb. 2-4

* Started thinking about possible project proposals and reviewing the underdetermined least squares, quantile regression and related literatures for ideas.

## Jan. 28

* Finished first draft of summary.

## Jan. 27

* Continue literature review and write related literature section.

## Jan. 26

* Looked for related literature.

## Jan. 25

* First meeting.
* Continued draft of summary.

## Jan. 23-24

* Started draft of summary.

## Jan. 22

* Looked for references on free probability and random matrix theory.

## Jan. 19-21

* Read paper in detail and took notes.
